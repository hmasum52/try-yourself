### Property based testing

Property based testing is a testing methodology that allows you to test your code against a set of properties that you define. This is in contrast to example based testing where you test your code against a set of examples. 

The idea is that you define a set of properties that your code should satisfy and then you use a property based testing library to generate random inputs to test your code against.

The most popular property based testing library 
- for Python is [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
- for JavaScript is [jsverify](http://jsverify.github.io/), [fast-check](github.com/dubzzz/fast-check), and [testcheck-js]()
- for Java is [QuickTheories](), [jqwik](https://jqwik.net/), and [Jqwik](https://jqwik.net/).
